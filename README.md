###This is a little test app to showcase a little bit of your front end skills. The app utilizes AngularJS, jQuery, and Foundation.



 **CDN Urls for dependencies:**

- jQuery: https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.1.4/jquery.min.js

- AngularJS: https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.4.2/angular.min.js

- Foundation (JS): https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/foundation/5.5.2/js/foundation.min.js

- Foundation (CSS): https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/foundation/5.5.2/css/foundation.min.css


## What we need:

One of our devs started a responsive task manager app that a user can use to make a list of tasks. He left in the middle of developing it, so we want you to finish it.

*Some notes:*
- Along with adding tasks, a user must be able to update and delete existing tasks
- User should be prompted (with Foundation modal) to confirm deletion task
- We'd like bug fix tasks to be highlighted red in the task list
- We'd like to keep task names under 25 characters long
- We'd like all fields to be filled out (with feedback if user errors, a simple browser alert will do)
- We'd like the "Types" select list to be populated from JS, in case we make that dynamic later
- Stored tasks should have a timestamp of when they were created
- If there aren't any current tasks, we'd like it to say "No Tasks" where the list is
- It would be great if we could simply click a task in the list to load it on the form (hover highlighting would be great too, maybe with CSS animations)

We want it styled similar to this: [Style Images](http://imgur.com/a/heFa1)

Fancy Bonus! Upon page load, if you could make the form fade in, followed by the list, you will be considered "fancy".
